CASPER Prime
Cognitive Agent System for Planning, Execution & Refinement
An autonomous AI development platform that leverages multi-agent orchestration to build software with minimal human intervention. CASPER Prime represents a paradigm shift from traditional development - simply describe what you want, and watch as specialized AI agents collaborate to deliver production-ready code.
Vision
CASPER Prime embodies the "fire and forget" philosophy of development. Rather than managing individual AI conversations or copy-pasting between tools, CASPER Prime orchestrates an entire team of specialized agents that handle task decomposition, implementation, testing, and integration autonomously.
Core Architecture
Agent Hierarchy

Master Prime - Orchestrates task decomposition and agent spawning
Frontend Prime - Specializes in UI/UX, React, and client-side architecture
Backend Prime - Handles APIs, databases, and server infrastructure
Testing Prime - Creates comprehensive test suites and validation
Worker Agents - Single-file specialists spawned for specific tasks

Context Management (R&D Framework)
The R&D Framework ensures efficient context usage across agents:

Reduce - Compress and summarize information
Delegate - Pass minimal context to specialized agents

Key Features

Autonomous Task Decomposition - Master agent analyzes complexity and spawns appropriate specialists
Context-Aware Handoffs - Agents pass refined context, not entire conversations
Real-time Monitoring - Dashboard shows agent pipeline and progress
Token Optimization - Intelligent context management reduces API costs
File System Integration - Agents read/write actual project files

How It Works

Describe Your Task: "Build a user authentication system with JWT and password reset"
Master Agent Analyzes: Determines complexity, required agents, and creates execution plan
Agents Spawn: Specialized agents are created for frontend, backend, database, and testing
Autonomous Development: Agents work in parallel, handing off context as needed
Code Generation: Actual files are created in the output directory
Integration: Master agent ensures all components work together

Use Cases

Rapid Prototyping - Build MVPs in hours instead of days
Feature Development - Add complex features to existing projects
Code Modernization - Refactor legacy code with modern patterns
Test Generation - Create comprehensive test suites automatically
API Development - Build complete REST/GraphQL APIs
Full-Stack Applications - Create entire applications from description

Quick Start
bash# Start CASPER Prime
cd casper-prime
./start.sh

# Open dashboard
open http://localhost:9318

# Enter task description
"Build a real-time chat application with user authentication"
Configuration
env# API Keys (required)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-claude-api-key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-gpt-api-key

# Settings
CASPER_MAX_TOKENS_PER_TASK=100000
CASPER_MAX_COST_PER_TASK=10.00
Dashboard
The real-time dashboard provides:

Agent Pipeline - Visual kanban of agent states
Token Usage - Track API consumption and costs
Decision Tree - View agent reasoning and handoffs
Output Files - Direct access to generated code

Technology Stack

Backend: Python 3.11+, FastAPI, WebSocket
Frontend: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
AI Models: Claude 3 Sonnet, GPT-4
Orchestration: Custom agent framework with context management

Philosophy
CASPER Prime believes that developers should focus on what to build, not how to build it. By treating AI agents as autonomous team members rather than tools, we enable a new paradigm of software development where human creativity drives innovation while AI handles implementation.
